* Simple Python Chart

** Why
This chart contains mostly everything that is needed to run simple python scripts within Kubernetes environment. The goal is to simplify running small scripts, without needing to build separate container images, or define boilerplate yaml definitions for every usecase.

** Examples
There is an example directory, that contains some functionalities that can be achieved with this chart. The directory will grow over time. Some simple ideas that can be done with just single python script:
- Cleanup of bare/failed/other pods
- Cleanup of other unnecessary resources
- Cloning resources between namespaces (ex: secrets)
- Prometheus exporters
- Host access PV management (ex: log access)
